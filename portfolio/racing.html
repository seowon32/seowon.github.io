<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<section class="section reveal">
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p class="small">
    Designed and built a competition RC race car by integrating drivetrain, chassis,
    steering, and electronics into a lightweight high-performance vehicle. The project
    emphasized mechanical subsystem optimization, manufacturability, and reliability
    under real track racing conditions.
  </p>
</section>

<!-- ENGINEERING OBJECTIVES -->
<section class="section reveal">
  <h2>Engineering Objectives</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Optimize powertrain efficiency and torque delivery</li>
    <li>Design structurally robust yet lightweight chassis</li>
    <li>Develop stable steering system with predictable handling</li>

    <li>Analyzed failure modes including belt slip and steering stability limitations</li>
    <li>Drove iterative mechanical design improvements based on test results</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- POWERTRAIN DESIGN -->
<section class="section reveal">
  <h2>Powertrain Design</h2>

  <p class="small">
    The vehicle utilized a belt-driven transmission to transfer motor torque
    to the drivetrain. During integration, pulley availability required ratio changes,
    introducing new tension and reliability challenges.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Redesigned belt tensioning to prevent slip during high torque conditions</li>
    <li>Added retention hardware to maintain drivetrain stability during racing loads</li>
    <li>Balanced torque multiplication with top-speed performance</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- CHASSIS DESIGN -->
<section class="section reveal">
  <h2>Chassis & Structural Design</h2>

  <p class="small">
    The chassis was additively manufactured using nylon to maximize strength
    while minimizing mass. Structural geometry was optimized to handle crash
    loads and vibration without excessive weight penalty.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Optimized chassis stiffness and load paths through CAD iteration</li>
    <li>Selected nylon for impact resistance and manufacturability</li>
    <li>Designed structural mounting points for subsystem integration</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- STEERING -->
<section class="section reveal">
  <h2>Steering & Vehicle Dynamics</h2>

  <p class="small">
    Initial Ackermann steering concepts were simplified to parallel steering due
    to packaging constraints and fabrication complexity. Real-world testing
    revealed tradeoffs between theoretical steering geometry and physical
    steering limits.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Evaluated steering geometry effects on turning radius and stability</li>
    <li>Identified compliance and mechanical tolerance as key performance drivers</li>
    <li>Implemented mechanical reinforcement to maintain steering consistency</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- PERFORMANCE RESULTS -->
<section class="section reveal">
  <h2>Performance Results</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Top Speed: ~4.5 m/s</li>
    <li>Acceleration: ~3 m/s²</li>
    <li>Lap Time: 15 seconds</li>
    <li>Maintained mechanical and electrical functionality throughout race event</li>
  </ul>
</section>

<!-- ENGINEERING LESSONS -->
<section class="section reveal">
  <h2>Engineering Lessons</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Manufacturing constraints strongly influence final design decisions</li>
    <li>Drivetrain performance depends heavily on mechanical stability and tolerance control</li>
    <li>Theoretical steering models must be validated through physical system testing</li>
    <li>Subsystem integration is critical to overall vehicle performance</li>
  </ul>
